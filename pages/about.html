                        In the 19th century, a Scottish spice merchant and explorer left his homeland in pursuit of
                        exotic spices. Eventually, he found himself in Galle, Sri Lanka, where he met and married a
                        local seamstress renowned for her beralu lace craftsmanship. Together, they transformed their
                        home into a repository of art, literature, and souvenirs from their global explorations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, this historic residence stands as The Sun House, a testament to the legacy of this
                        Scottish merchant and his Sri Lankan wife. It remains a place where travellers can immerse
                        themselves in the couple's captivating history and the diverse treasures they collected during
                        their remarkable journeys.

                        Perched high on a hill, yet only a five minute stroll away from the centre of the seaside town
                        of Galle, this famous property is renowned for its sprawling gardens, and eclectic collection of
                        artwork, books and furniture.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The house, since its initial construction in 1860, has been home to some of Galle’s most notable
                        characters. From the visionary Scottish Merchant & Explorer, to the colourful American Designer
                        ‘Dick Dumas’ and the pioneering hospitality specialist Geoffrey Dobbs (to name just a few), all
                        of whom left their own discernable mark on the style and personality of this glorious property.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now, in 2023, the house has been carefully restored to showcase the history of Sri Lanka,
                        particularly Galle and its people, all through the unique perspectives of the property's former
                        owners and residents.

                        Each of the property’s seven rooms/suites has been distinctively designed to capture a piece of
                        its rich history:

                        Welcome to "The Gallean," a culinary voyage that captures a legendary spice merchant's
                        extraordinary life. Nestled within the original spice stores of the property, the menu marries
                        the vibrant diversity of Asian flavours with the heritage of Galle.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each dish and cocktail is a blend of local ingredients and spices discovered on his voyages,
                        resulting in a dining experience that is as exotic as it is familiar. It's a tribute to a true
                        “Gallean” who, despite his global travels, chose to make Galle his home.
